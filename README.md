## Overview
Hawai‚Äòi has nearly 7,000 EVs registered, second only to California in per capita adoption rate. In 2017, Hawai‚Äòi‚Äôs four counties announced their commitment to 100 percent clean transportation by 2045 and the conversion of their own fleets by 2035. The rate of EV sales in Hawaii also continues to increase each year. In January 2015, the number of plug-in passenger vehicles (BEVs, PHEVs and NEVs) registered in the state was 3,243, a 46% increase from January 2014. 

This new energy initiative will require the proper infrastructure to support it. Our tool provides a dashboard for monitoring energy usage across EV charging stations, ways to help predict peak times of use, and an alert system to help notify maintainers of downtimes/shortages. 

Our interactive forecasting tool provides a unique perspective into helping determine when a charging station is operating at peak congestion and helps visualize where more EV charging stations are needed.
